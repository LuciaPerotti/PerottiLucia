        <h1>Rhode Futures Foundation</h1>
        <p>
            The Rhode Futures Foundation is investing in and supporting 1000 women* and their families by 2023. We are partnering with three organizations that provide women, especially women of color, with the resources needed to direct their own futures: Accion Opportunity Fund, Black Mamas Matter Alliance, and the LIFT Family Goal Fund. Rhode has committed a minimum of 1% of sales to support their efforts and the women they serve.
            *For all women, including non-binary, trans, non-cis, and all women-identified persons.
            <br>for our health:<br>
            Black Mamas Matter Alliance, Inc. (BMMA) is a national network of Black women-led organizations and multi-disciplinary professionals that works across the full spectrum of maternal and reproductive health. BMMA operates at the national, state, and local levels to advance policy, promote holistic maternity care, cultivate research, and uplift culture to advance Black Maternal Health for Black women and birthing people. We envision a world where all Black mamas have the rights, respect, and resources to thrive before, during, and after pregnancy.
            <br>for our families:<br>
            LIFT is a national non-profit that invests in low-income families to break generational cycles of poverty and promotes wellbeing, social connection, and financial stability. LIFT strengthens families by providing cash buffers to parents (mostly moms) so they can work toward long-term success. With LIFT’s support, mothers reinvest in their careers, further their goals, and provide a better future for themselves and their families—regardless of race, ethnicity, or zip code.
            <br>for our future:<br>
            For over 25 years, Accion Opportunity Fund has provided financial support to small businesses predominantly owned by women, people of color, and immigrants. Accion Opportunity Fund believes that small businesses are the heart of the community, essential to local economic health, and create opportunities for individuals, families, and entire neighborhoods. Accion Opportunity Fund offers capital, resources, and coaching so these entrepreneurs can achieve long-term success.</p>
